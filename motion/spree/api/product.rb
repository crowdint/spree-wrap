    # This Module is included in the Spree Module so you should call its
    # methods directly from Spree.

      #
      # To view the details for a single product, make a request using that product's permalink:
      #
      #   Spree.product("a-product") do |product|
      #     # ...
      #   end
      #
      # You may also query by the product's id attribute:
      #
      #   Spree.product("id") do |product|
      #     # ...
      #   end
      #
      # Note that the API will attempt a permalink lookup before an ID lookup.
      #
      def product(id, &block)
        object_query(Spree::Product, product_uri(id), &block)
      end
